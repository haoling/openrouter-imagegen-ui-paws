paws is a private, self-hosted web interface for generating images via AI models available on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Private & Self-Hosted**: All your generated images and settings are stored locally in `indexedDB`.
- **Broad Model Support**: Use any image generation model available on your OpenRouter account.
- **Real-time Streaming**: Watch images materialize in real-time via streaming generation chunks.
- **Persistent Settings**: Your chosen model, resolution, aspect ratio and prompt history are saved between sessions.
- **Authentication**: Optional user/password authentication for added security.
- **Google Drive**: Optional, serverless Google sign-in to connect a Drive folder for syncing.

### Generation Control
- **Reference Images**: Attach up to 4 reference images to guide the generation (vision models).
- **Resolution & Aspect Ratio**: Explicitly request `1K`, `2K` or `4K` resolutions and specific aspect ratios (or let the model decide).
- **System Messages**: Use the built-in optimal system prompt or provide your own custom instructions.
- **Prompt History**: Your last prompt is saved locally so you can pick up where you left off.

### Rich UI & UX
- **Grid Gallery**: View all your generated images in a responsive, dynamic grid.
- **Image Specifications**: See the requested resolution and calculated aspect ratio directly on the image card.
- **Advanced Model Selection**:
  - Pricing badges show costs for `1K`, `2K` and `4K` generations.
  - Fuzzy search helps you quickly find the exact model you need.
  - Favorite models and drag-and-drop to reorder them for quick access.
- **Usage Tracking**: Keep track of your spending with a clickable usage display that cycles through daily, weekly, monthly and total costs.
- **Download & Retry**: Easily download high-resolution results or retry failed generations.

## Built With

**Frontend**
- Vanilla JavaScript and CSS
- [Dexie](https://dexie.org/) for IndexedDB storage
- [msgpackr](https://github.com/kriszyp/msgpackr) for efficient streaming data transfer
- Color palette: [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://catppuccin.com/)

**Backend**
- Go
- [chi/v5](https://go-chi.io/) for the http routing/server
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for model list and image generation

## Getting Started

1. Copy `example.config.yml` to `config.yml` and set `tokens.openrouter`:
```bash
cp example.config.yml config.yml
```

2. Build and run:
```bash
go build -o paws
./paws
```

3. Open `http://localhost:3444` in your browser.

### Configuration (`config.yml`)

```yaml
# enable verbose logging and diagnostics
debug: false

tokens:
  # server secret for signing auth tokens; auto-generated if empty
  secret: ""
  # openrouter.ai api token (required)
  openrouter: ""

server:
  # port to serve paws on (required; default 3444)
  port: 3444

settings:
  # the http timeout to use for completion requests in seconds (optional; default: 300s)
  timeout: 1200
  # the interval in which the model list is refreshed in minutes (optional; default: 30m)
  refresh-interval: 30

authentication:
  # require login with username and password
  enabled: true
  # list of users with bcrypt password hashes
  users:
  - username: admin
    password: $2a$12$eH6Du2grC7aOUDmff2SrC.yKPWea/fq0d76c3JsvhGxhGCEOnWTRy

google:
  # oauth 2.0 client id for "Google Drive" integration (optional; leave empty to disable)
  client-id: ""
```

## Authentication (optional)

paws supports simple, stateless authentication. If enabled, users must log in with a username and password before accessing the interface. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (12 rounds). If `authentication.enabled` is set to `false`, paws will not prompt for authentication at all.

```yaml
authentication:
  enabled: true
  users:
  - username: admin
    password: $2a$12$eH6Du2grC7aOUDmff2SrC.yKPWea/fq0d76c3JsvhGxhGCEOnWTRy
```

After a successful login, paws issues a signed (HMAC-SHA256) token, using the server secret (`tokens.secret` in `config.yml`). This is stored as a cookie and re-used for future authentications.

## Google Drive (optional)

paws can optionally connect to Google Drive entirely client-side, using [Google Identity Services](https://developers.google.com/identity/oauth2/web/guides/overview) — no server-side OAuth client secret is required or stored.

To enable it:

1. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (Application type: `Web application`) and add the origin(s) paws is served on (e.g. `https://images.example.com`) to **Authorized JavaScript origins**.
2. Set `google.client-id` in `config.yml` to that Client ID.

```yaml
google:
  client-id: "your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
```

Once configured, a Google Drive button appears next to the usage display. Connecting requests the following, minimal set of permissions:

- `drive.appdata` — read/write access to paws' own hidden, app-specific data folder.
- `drive.file` — read/write access to a Drive folder you explicitly select.
- `drive.metadata.readonly` — lets paws list your folders so you can pick one to sync to.

The resulting access token is only ever held in the browser and is never sent to, or stored by, the paws server.

## Nginx (optional)

When running behind a reverse proxy like nginx, you can have the proxy serve static files.

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name images.example.com;
    http2 on;

    root /path/to/paws/static;

    location / {
        index index.html index.htm;

        etag on;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=2592000, must-revalidate";
        expires 30d;
    }

    location ~ ^/- {
        proxy_pass       http://127.0.0.1:3443;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header Host            $host;
    }

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
}
```

## Usage

- Generate an image with `Ctrl+Enter` or the **Generate Image** button.
- Attach **Reference Images** by clicking the `+` button or pasting images directly into the prompt area.
- Hover over a generated image to **download** or **retry** the generation.
- Click the **Usage Display** in the top left to cycle through daily, weekly, monthly and total usage costs.
- Middle-click a model in the dropdown to add it to your **Favorites**.
